# PanNuke_NoNuSeg_cpm17_ConSep_Preprocess

A repository for preprocessing widely used H&E image datasets, including PanNuke, MoNuSeg, CPM17, and ConSep, to facilitate nuclei segmentation tasks with deep learning models.

## Datasets

### PanNuke
PanNuke is an H&E stained image dataset containing 7,904 256 Ã— 256 patches from 19 different tissue types. The nuclei are classified into the following categories:
- Neoplastic
- Inflammatory
- Connective/Soft Tissue
- Dead
- Epithelial Cells

The dataset is divided into three folds for use in cross-validation. You can download the dataset [here](https://jgamper.github.io/PanNukeDataset/).

#### Prepare the Data

After downloading the PanNuke dataset, you will receive three `.zip` files named `fold1.zip`, `fold2.zip`, and `fold3.zip`. These files contain the data stored as NumPy arrays. Once extracted, the directory structure will be as follows:

```
ðŸ“¦Fold 1
 â”£ ðŸ“‚images
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“‚fold1
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œimages.npy
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œtypes.npy
 â”£ ðŸ“‚masks
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“‚fold1
 â”ƒ â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œmasks.npy
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œby-nc-sa.md
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md
 â”— ðŸ“œREADME.md
```
Fold 2 and 3 also have similar structure

how to run the preprocess code:

```bash
python3 pannuke_process.py
```
The following is a sample of the preprocessed output:

### Instructions for Preparation
1. Download the `.zip` files from the [official PanNuke dataset page](https://jgamper.github.io/PanNukeDataset/).
2. Extract each `.zip` file into a separate folder (`Fold 1`, `Fold 2`, `Fold 3`).
3. Verify the directory structure as shown above.

You are now ready to preprocess the data using this repository.
